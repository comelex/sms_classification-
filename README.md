📱 SMS Classification
Welcome to the SMS Classification project! This project aims to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (not spam) using machine learning techniques. The project is implemented in Python and leverages popular libraries such as Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NLTK for text processing and machine learning.


SMS spam is a significant issue that affects millions of users worldwide. This project aims to build an efficient and accurate model to classify SMS messages into spam and ham categories. By using a well-labeled dataset and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, this project demonstrates how to preprocess text data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance.
